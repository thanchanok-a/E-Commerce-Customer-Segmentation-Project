# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation-Project
##📌Overview
Customer segmentation analysis of the Amazon ecosystem utilizing advanced data mining techniques using K-means clustering for numerical data, K-modes clustering for categorical variables.
This research demonstrates how data-driven customer segmentation can help support significantly improved personalization efforts, improve strategies,and boost customer experience in online
retailers like Amazon.
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, VaderSentiment , K-Means , K-Modes )  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Other Tools:** Google Collab Noteboo
## 📂 Dataset
- Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/code/swathiunnikrishnan/consumer-behaviour-analysis-of-amazon-a-study for 2023)

   - Converted date fields and created derived features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized purchase patterns and customer behavior.  
   - Identified trends using histograms, bar charts, Heat maps.
3. **Modeling / Analysis**
   - Applied K-Means and K-Modes clustering for customer segmentation.  
   - Evaluated model performance using Elbow method and silhouette score.
4. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Do the segment profiling and create the table to communicate results.  
## 📊 Key Insights
-Price sensitivity is the main driver; service, sustainability, and product quality are key improvement areas.
